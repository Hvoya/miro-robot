    1: `<p>MIRO is an open platform for conducting educational and research activities in the field of mobile robotics. The mobile robot MIRO is available for reproduction in any FabLab and research group.  The solution includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>documentation and materials for the production and assembly of a mobile robot,</li>
      <li>prepared development environment (API, firmware, images of operating systems and virtual machines)</li>
      <li>educational materials</li>
      <li>digital platform (web resource) for the exchange of experience and developments.</li>

    2: `<p>
    The MIRO robot uses low-cost serial components and minimum types of 
	technological operations during production and assembly.
    Robots made and assembled in different parts of the world will be able to use common hardware and software solutions. 
	Unification affects many aspects of a mobile robot (mechanical parts, widely available electronic components, wiring diagrams).
    MIRO allows teams located at different ends of the globe to enter into effective collaboration when conducting research or development 
	at the base of a mobile robot - the exchange of results turns into a simple exchange of software implementations (firmwares).
